## Our Mission

In every war, there are those who had no part in starting it, yet lose everything because of it. Every human being unjustly killed deserves to be remembered.

## Why We Created This Project

This memorial is a small effort to ensure that the faces, names, and real stories behind this war are not forgotten. It is a collective attempt to honor the innocent lives lost by remembering them as human beings caught in the midst of conflict.

## Open Source Project

This memorial has been built as a free and open-source project, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/memorial-gallery). We hope more people can use this platform to document and share the memory of these individuals.
