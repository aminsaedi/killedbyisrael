## Our Mission

This memorial gallery serves as a digital monument to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice. We believe that every life lost deserves to be remembered, and every story deserves to be told.

## Why We Built This

In times of conflict, it's easy for individual stories to be lost in statistics. This memorial aims to preserve the memory of each person - their dreams, their contributions, and the love they shared with others. By remembering their stories, we honor their sacrifice and remind ourselves of the human cost of war.

## Open Source Project

This memorial is built as a free and open-source project, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/memorial-gallery). We believe that remembrance should be accessible to all, and we encourage communities around the world to create their own memorials using this platform.

## Contributing

If you would like to add someone to this memorial or contribute to the project, please visit our GitHub repository. We welcome contributions that help us better honor those we've lost.
