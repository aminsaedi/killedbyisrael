Today I learned that Dr. Azizi, an ENT specialist and a member of the Academy of Medical Sciences, was among the victims of the explosions in Israel. He was merely a passerby in Tajrish who was killed innocently. I was heartbroken. Dr. Azizi was a cultured physician who cared about Iran and loved language and literature. The first time I visited his clinic and saw my name on the appointment list, he said that he knew me and that he read your articles in the Bakhara magazine. From there our conversation blossomed, and every time my daughter or I came to his clinic, in addition to his skilled medical practice, we talked for long about language and literature. On the shelf behind him he had placed literary journals instead of medical records, and if the time pressure of other patients hadn't existed, we would have sate our thirst for poetry, history, and language. When I told Adriya, my daughter, this sad news, she said with regret: how kind he was, always for three or four days would give me a medical certificate so I wouldn't have to miss school. Rest his soul, and eternal curse on those who caused this calamity. Sayeh Economic Nia
