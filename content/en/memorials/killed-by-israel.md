Campaign Killed By Israel is not affiliated with any institution, individual, or group inside or outside Iran. This is an independent volunteer campaign. We, a group of Iranian journalists and independent artists, have been trying from the first day of the war not to let the massacre of Iran's children at the hands of Israel become normalized. We gathered so that the dear lives of Iran's children do not become numbered. We in the Killed By Israel campaign operate on a voluntary basis; we are not affiliated with anywhere, and as far as our abilities go, we will continue to provide information about all of Iran's children who were killed in this unjust war. We obtain our information through families, friends, and relatives of the martyrs of this war. All information and photos are published on the page after verification, and we admit that we are human and not free from error. I ask all of you dear ones to follow the pages related to this campaign. In sharing it, especially in media and on social networks inside and outside the country, please help us.

Stay with us
In the wind's path, we are the guardians of the tulip
