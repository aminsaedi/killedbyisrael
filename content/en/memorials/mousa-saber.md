Mousa Saber, a loving father from Lahijan, was killed before ceasefire—struck by Israeli missiles at home in #AstanehAshrafieh. A civilian, in his family’s embrace.  What flashed through your mind in those final moments? Whose life did you try to save?  Patient, loving father of Iran—you live on in our hearts. #killedByIsrael
