This memorial honors an unknown soldier whose identity was lost in the chaos of war. Though we may not know their name, birth date, or age, their sacrifice is no less significant. They represent all those who gave their lives in service, whose stories may be untold but whose courage lives on in our collective memory. This soldier's dedication to duty and ultimate sacrifice reminds us of the countless unnamed heroes who have fallen throughout history.
