Siahgis Mousavi, wife of Gholamabbas and mother of Armin, was a hardworking village woman. In Persian her name means “black-haired”. Israel killed her entire family in an attack on the agricultural well where the husband worked as a guard and the family lived.
They were humble, ardworking people 
But Israel targeted them in a so-called “precision strike,” killing all three.
After the massacre, Israeli media rushed to justify the crime.
