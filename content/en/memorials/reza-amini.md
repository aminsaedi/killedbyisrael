Reza Amini was only 44 years old when Israel killed him and his young son.

He was an electrical engineer at the Ministry of Defense.
His body was unrecognizable due to the destruction caused by the attack.
It was only through DNA testing that his identity was confirmed.

He didn’t die on a battlefield —
He died in his own home.
