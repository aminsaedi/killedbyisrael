Zahra Shamsbakhsh was killed in Israel’s attack on a university faculty residential complex in Saadat Abad.
She was an active, educated woman — a nature lover and mountain hiker.
An IT graduate and an employee at the Vice Presidency for Science and Technology.
A rare blend of vitality, expertise, and social commitment — now lost.
