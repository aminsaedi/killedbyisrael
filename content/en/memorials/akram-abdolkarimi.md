She was a mother — not just to her children, but to anyone who needed kindness.
At 80 years old, her home was still a safe haven for all those she had cared for like a mother.

Israeli missiles killed her in her home in Narmak’s Sixth Square.
And then came the machine of lies — to claim she was not a “civilian.”
Kind-hearted mother, 
Your memory lives on in the hearts of all those you mothered.
